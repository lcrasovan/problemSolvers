This is intended to be a space for problem solving using various JS tools and libraries

**MAGIC HEXAGON PROBLEM**

such that the sum of each edge in the construction equals the same amount

 one solution for sum 22 is

           1   18   3

       14   19    17    15

    7    13     2     16     4

       6     11    12    10

          9     5     8

  equivalent - computational formulation

     Find twelve combinations such that:

     1 number appears 6 times
     6 numbers appear 3 times and the other
     12 numbers appear only once

 uses underscoreJs and D3 for graphics
 nice concepts as recursivity and memoising are illustrated

**TWELVE STICKS PROBLEM / CONSTANT PERIMETER PROBLEM**
 
Find all closed shapes on a quadricular grid that have the same perimeter

Equivalent stick problem: find all closed quadricular shapes one can build with an even number of sticks of the same length

The solution finder - based on the backtracking algorithm  - is built in JS using the D3 library for graphics

Enjoy!
